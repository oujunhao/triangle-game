* Grade 10 trigonometry game
I hacked this together to make a simple game for triangle practice. We're learning =sin=, =cos=, and =tan=, as well as the sin and cos laws in math class. I'm trying to learn JavaScript, so I made a simple mobile thing that randomly generates triangles (biased to make a lot of them right-angled) and asks for a side length. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

** Things to implement:
- desktop-friendly version
- fix the bottom text entry box
- ask for angles
- draw the arcs to indicate angles
- try out the Onsen UI framework
- global scoreboard to record high scores
